# imgcolour
imgcolor - is a python program, which runs in CMD and gives you the RGB colour code of a certain place on the image.


**How it works**

You need to specify the picture you need in the code. After that run the program and a new window will open with your image. Now you just need to click wherever you want and the exact RGB colour code of that position will be shown in the CMD.
