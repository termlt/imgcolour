# imgcolour
imgcolour - is a python program, which runs in CMD and gives you colour info of a certain place on the image.


**How it works**

You need to specify the picture you need in the code. After that run the program and a new window will open with your image. Now you just need to click wherever you want and the **Name of the colour, HEX, RGB code** of that position will be shown in the CMD.
